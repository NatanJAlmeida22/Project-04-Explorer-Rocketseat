## ðŸš€ Technologies

This project was developed with the following technologies

- HTML and CSS
- Git and GitHub
- Figma

## Project

Project-03 was meant to introduce basic HTML and CSS concepts. In this project I had the opportunity to improve my knowledge about:

- responsiveness, making the site adapt to different screen resolutions;
- mobile-first concept;
- flexible measurement units (% and rem), with these measurements we can build fully responsive applications;
- adjust and align text according to Figma layout;
- website adaptation adjustments for mobile devices;
- "max-width" property (establishing a maximum width for the elements);
- "Desktop" version, applying the @media corresponding to the size of the device;
- importance of testing the project on various devices (cell phones, emulators, among others).
